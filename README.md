# Dependencies

- `cwiid` 
  - https://github.com/abstrakraft/cwiid

I could not build and install every `make` rule, but did install `wmgui` application, `cwiid` python library (this project's dependency).
To check if the lib is properly installed, open a Python interpreter in the desired environment and try `import cwiid`.

- `imgui` + `pygame`
